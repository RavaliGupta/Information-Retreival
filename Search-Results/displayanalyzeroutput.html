(a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemicalreaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusionacross streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which thevolume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/compared to diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas densitynear the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the densityjust outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnationenthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in themore familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, incase (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface isrepresented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradientvalue, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtaineddirectly in terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order toillustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special casesof an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by aspherical segment .in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling thediffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as thelow-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replacedby the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) arealso applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rateis similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heattransfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case ofthermodynamic equilibrium is given by..  (prandtl no./schmidt no .)when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by taking a reasonable valueof atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30 .additional theoretical and (especially)

.</td><td>report 944</td><td>heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the upperatmosphere .a general method has been developed, using the methods of kinetictheory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated forsteady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas .  the particular solutionwas made for a flat plate., however, the calculations can be easilyextended to bodies of arbitrary shape .it was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence ofsolar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes ofnegligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up tosteady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per second .  the effect of solarradiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasinglyimportant as the flight altitude is increased .  at an altitude of 150miles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor thatdetermines skin temperature .  owing to the strong effect of solarradiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability ofnocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures .in order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that theangle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path shouldbe kept as small as possible .  this may be accomplished in practiceby designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body atsmall angles of attack .it is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuringthermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positiveand negative angles with respect to the flight path .  as much surfaceas possible should be inclined at negative angles .  practically,this may be accomplished by boattailing the body .in the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it isshown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order ofmagnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturallyby emitted radiation .  if the cooling rate is below the naturalradiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures .it is shown that, in the case of a missile designed to fly over a widerange of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivityof the skin as high as possible .  this conclusion, however, isbased upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independentof the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy .a possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated bythe decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease inthermal accommodation coefficient .  this phenomenon may beused to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodationcoefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin .</td></tr><tr><td>489</td><td>morduchow,m.</td><td>on calculation of

 both methods provide forarbitrary external loading, are general with respect to theorientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundaryconditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as anetwork of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes .  in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained byexpressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations,equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationshipsin terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution fordeflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of aninverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions .  in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary areassembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a stepby-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary .the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications ofsquare matrices composed independently for the differenttransfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relativelysmall matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundaryconditions .  comparisons of theoretical results with experimental data

through a laminarboundary layer on the isothermalsurface of an electrically heated,cylindrical body of revolution with ahemispherical nose was determined fromwind-tunnel tests at a mach numberof 1.97

to a value  of 0.43 0.05 at thejunction with the cylindricalafterbody .  because measurements of thestatic pressure distribution overthe hemisphere indicated that the localflow pattern tended to becomestationary as the free-stream mach numberwas increased to 3.8, thisdistribution of heat-transfer parameter isbelieved representative of allmach numbers greater than 1.97 and oftemperatures less than that ofdissociation .  the local heat-transferparameter was independent of reynoldsnumber based on body diameter in therange from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10 .  the measured distribution ofheat-transfer parameter agreed withintheoretical distribution calculated withforeknowledge only of the pressuredistribution about the body .  thismethod, applicable to any body ofrevolution with an isothermal surface,combines the mangler transformation,stewartson transformation, and thermalsolutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flowproblem, and thus evaluates theheat-transfer rate in axisymmetriccompressible flow in terms of the knownheat-transfer rate in an approximatelyequivalent two-dimensionalincompressible flow .  measurements of recovery-temperaturedistributions at mach numbersof 1.97 and 3.04 yielded local recoveryfactors having an average valueof 0.823 0.012 on the hemisphere whichincreased abruptly at the shoulderto an average value of 0.840 0.012 onthe cylindrical afterbody .

treated theoretically by extending the basic shock-layer concept . in the outer inviscid flow, a modelconsisting of a detached shock layer and an entropy layer is introducedto account for bluntness . in the boundary layer, the approximatesolution is found to be governed by a local flat-plate similarity . underthe assumption of a strong bow shock and a specific heat ratio close tounity, a theory is developed for an arbitrary thin body . for flat-plate afterbodies, the theory yields a solution agreeing with blast-wavetheory at one limit and strong-interaction theory at the other . withinthe framework of the present theory, the problems involving angle ofattack are also analyzed . complementary to the above study, ahypersonic similitude involving strong shocks, but not requiring close to one a natural comparison with experimental data correlated on the basis ofthis similitude .flat-plate experiments in air, conducted in the c.a.l. 11 x 15-dashin.hypersonic shock tunnel under cold-wall

transfer due to a highly-cooled noncatalytic surface can increasefrom stall of adjacent stages .the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speedoperation were also considered . this phase of the study indicated thatsuch compromises would severely reduce the complete-compressor-stallmargin . furthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferredfrom the inlet stages to the
